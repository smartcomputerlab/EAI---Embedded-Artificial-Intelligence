# EmbeddedAI
This repo contains the preparations for Embedded AI laboratories.

We are going to work on several hrdware platforms including RPI, Google CORAL and Nvidia Jetson boards.
The training of the models is done on Google Colab with TensorFlow/Keras. The execution is done on our hardware platforms mainly with TensorFlow Lite.
